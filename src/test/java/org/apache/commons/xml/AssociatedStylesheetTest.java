/**
 * Checks that {@code getAssociatedStylesheet} scans for {@code xml-stylesheet} PIs without fetching an external DTD declared in the document prolog.
 *
 * <p>The PI scan parses the prolog, where a {@code DOCTYPE} with an external subset is processed before the root element. On Apache Xalan the scan runs on a
 * reader the engine provisions itself, ignoring a hardened reader passed in a {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource} (XALANJ-2849); the wrapper works around
 * that by handing Xalan a {@code DOMSource} it pre-parsed through a hardened {@code DocumentBuilder}. The JDK's XSLTC honors the hardened reader directly. Either
 * way the external DTD resolves to empty instead of being fetched. Tagged {@code trax}, so it runs on the stock JDK, Apache Xalan, Saxon, and the Android
 * runtime.</p>
