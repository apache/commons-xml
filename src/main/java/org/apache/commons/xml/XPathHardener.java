/**
 * Capability-driven hardening for any {@link XPathFactory} on the classpath.
 *
 * <p>The XPath object model mirrors TrAX: the stock JDK and Apache Xalan ship an XPath 1.0 engine with no URI-fetching functions, while Saxon adds the XPath 3.1
 * {@code fn:doc}, {@code fn:collection} and {@code fn:unparsed-text} functions that can reach external resources. Rather than branching on the implementation
 * class, {@link #harden(XPathFactory)} probes what the factory supports and adapts:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Saxon</strong> ({@code net.sf.saxon}): recognized by class name and handed to {@link SaxonProvider#configure(XPathFactory)}. Its URI-fetching
 *         functions and reflection-based extension calls are reachable only through a locked-down Saxon {@code Configuration}, not the standard JAXP knobs; this
 *         is the XPath counterpart of the Saxon exception in {@link TransformerHardener}, kept as a documented class-name exception because the required
 *         hardening surface is reachable only through a vendor API.</li>
 *     <li><strong>FODP</strong> ({@code jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser}, set to {@code false}): best-effort. On the stock JDK it pins the internal parser lookup to
 *         the bundled SAX parser, blocking a sysprop swap to a third-party parser (defense-in-depth); Xalan rejects the feature and is left unchanged.</li>
 *     <li><strong>FSP</strong> ({@link XMLConstants#FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING}): required. It is the only knob both the stock JDK and Xalan XPath engines expose,
 *         and switches on their secure-processing limits. {@link XPathFactory} has no attribute API for finer control.</li>
 * </ul>
