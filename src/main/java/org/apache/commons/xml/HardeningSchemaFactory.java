/**
 * Capability-driven hardening wrapper for any {@link SchemaFactory} on the classpath, the same recipe for every implementation. It is the entry point reached
 * by {@link XmlFactories#newSchemaFactory()}; there is no per-implementation branching, no {@code FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING} and no limit configuration on the
 * factory itself.
 *
 * <p>Three layers cooperate:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link HardeningSchemaFactory} installs a deny-all {@link Resolvers.DenyAll#LS_RESOURCE} on the factory (blocking
 *       {@code xs:import}/{@code xs:include}/{@code xs:redefine} at compile time) and rewrites the Source on every {@code newSchema(Source[])} entry point
 *       through {@link XmlFactories#harden(Source)}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link HardeningSchema} wraps every Validator/ValidatorHandler the inner Schema produces and re-installs the deny-all resolver on each (blocking
 *       {@code xsi:schemaLocation} at validation time), since neither the JDK nor Xerces reliably propagates it through {@code Schema}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link HardeningValidator} rewrites the Source on every {@link Validator#validate(Source)} call.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The hardened reader supplied by {@link XmlFactories#harden(Source)} already carries {@code FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING} and the processing limits, so a
 * DOCTYPE, external entity or Billion Laughs payload in the schema or instance document is bounded there rather than on this factory. The JAXP 1.5
 * {@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_*} properties are deliberately not set: the deny-all resolver already blocks the same fetches on every implementation, and the JDK 8
 * {@code SchemaFactory} has a bug whereby those properties keep blocking even when a caller's own resolver would grant the access, so leaving them unset lets a
 * caller re-enable specific lookups by swapping the resolver.</p>
