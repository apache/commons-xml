/**
 * Capability-driven hardening for any {@link XMLInputFactory} (StAX) on the classpath.
 *
 * <p>Rather than branching on the implementation class, {@link #harden(XMLInputFactory)} consolidates the JDK Zephyr and Woodstox recipes into one pass that
 * probes which properties each factory accepts and adapts:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Limits</strong>: applied best-effort by {@link Limits#tryApply(XMLInputFactory)}, which sets both the JDK and the Woodstox limit properties;
 *         each implementation honors its own and rejects the other's.</li>
 *     <li><strong>External DTD subset</strong>: skipped via Zephyr's {@value #ZEPHYR_IGNORE_EXTERNAL_DTD} (best-effort), so a DOCTYPE-only document parses
 *         without a fetch attempt instead of tripping the deny-all resolver below. Woodstox skips it through {@value #WSTX_DTD_RESOLVER} instead.</li>
 *     <li><strong>External entities</strong>: denied through a non-removable {@link Resolvers.FallbackDenyXMLResolver} floor on the entity-resolution hook,
 *         leaving the standard {@code SUPPORT_DTD} / {@code IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES} defaults untouched. Woodstox exposes fine-grained hooks, so when all
 *         three apply the factory is Woodstox: {@value #WSTX_DTD_RESOLVER} (empty external subset, but a thrown error on external parameter entities, which share
 *         that hook), {@value #WSTX_ENTITY_RESOLVER} (the floor, denying declared external general entities) and {@value #WSTX_UNDECLARED_ENTITY_RESOLVER}
 *         (silently drop undeclared references left by the skipped subset). Any factory that does not accept that trio (the JDK Zephyr, or an unrecognized
 *         implementation) instead gets the floor through {@code setXMLResolver}. Either way the factory is wrapped in a {@link HardeningXMLInputFactory} that
 *         routes a caller-set resolver through the floor rather than letting it replace the deny-all block.</li>
 * </ul>
