/**
 * Capability-driven hardening for any {@link DocumentBuilderFactory} on the classpath.
 *
 * <p>Rather than branching on the implementation class, {@link #harden(DocumentBuilderFactory)} probes what the factory supports and adapts:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Android</strong> (Harmony / KXmlParser): recognized by class name and left untouched. It exposes no {@link XMLConstants#FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING
 *         FSP}, no JAXP 1.5 {@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_*} and no attribute API at all, while KXmlParser silently drops user-defined entities, so there is nothing to
 *         apply.</li>
 *     <li><strong>FSP</strong>: required. It switches on the implementation's built-in security manager, which is what carries the processing limits.</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@code XERCES_LOAD_EXTERNAL_DTD}</strong>: optional. Where supported, it skips the external DTD subset on non-validating parsers so a
 *         DOCTYPE-only document parses without a fetch attempt. If not supported, the fetch will throw instead, due to the following settings.</li>
 *     <li><strong>Limits</strong>: applied best-effort by {@link Limits#tryApply(DocumentBuilderFactory)}, which adapts to the JDK attribute limits or Xerces'
 *         {@code SecurityManager} as appropriate.</li>
 *     <li><strong>Deny-all resolver floor</strong>: every produced {@link DocumentBuilder} is wrapped by a {@link HardeningDocumentBuilderFactory} that keeps a
 *         deny-all {@link EntityResolver} floor. That floor blocks external DTD, entity, schema and {@code xi:include} fetches in one place: the stock JDK's
 *         XInclude processor ignores {@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_*} and consults the {@link EntityResolver} instead, so no {@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_*} attributes are
 *         needed here. A caller can chain its own resolver onto the floor to allow-list resources, but cannot remove it.</li>
 * </ul>
