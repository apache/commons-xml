/**
 * Capability-driven hardening for any {@link TransformerFactory} on the classpath.
 *
 * <p>Rather than branching on the implementation class, {@link #harden(TransformerFactory)} probes what the factory supports and adapts:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Saxon</strong> ({@code net.sf.saxon}): recognized by class name and handed to {@link SaxonProvider#configure(TransformerFactory)}. Unlike XSLTC
 *         and Xalan, Saxon reaches external resources through several channels (the {@link URIResolver}, a collection finder, an unparsed-text resolver) on top
 *         of reflection-based extension functions, none of which the standard JAXP knobs can close; only a locked-down Saxon {@code Configuration} can. This is
 *         the TrAX counterpart of the Android special case in {@link DocumentBuilderHardener}, kept as a documented class-name exception because the required
 *         hardening surface is reachable only through a vendor API.</li>
 *     <li><strong>FSP</strong> ({@link XMLConstants#FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING}): required. On XSLTC it enables the runtime evaluator limits; on Xalan it disables
 *         reflection-based extension functions.</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD}</strong> (set to {@code ""}): required on XSLTC. XSLTC copies this factory attribute onto the reader that parses the
 *         stylesheet ({@code Util.getInputSource}), overwriting the {@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD} the wrapper's hardened reader had already set; without it a
 *         permissive default re-opens the external-DTD/entity channel during stylesheet compilation. Xalan rejects the attribute (best-effort, ignored) and closes
 *         that channel through the hardened reader instead. Its sibling {@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_STYLESHEET} is <em>not</em> set: the deny-all resolver below already
 *         guards the only channel it covers.</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@link Resolvers.FallbackDenyURIResolver} floor</strong>: required. A deny-all {@link URIResolver} floor, installed by
 *         {@link HardeningTransformerFactory} and carried onto every produced {@link Transformer}, blocks {@code xsl:import}/{@code xsl:include} at compile time
 *         and {@code document()} at runtime, the one channel both XSLTC and Xalan route through. A caller-set {@link URIResolver} is routed through the floor
 *         rather than replacing it, so a caller can opt a specific URI in but cannot drop the block.</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@link HardeningTransformerFactory}</strong>: required. Both implementations fall back to {@code SAXParserFactory.newInstance()} to parse a
 *         stylesheet or source document that does not carry its own reader, and only set FSP on it; wrapping the factory rewrites every {@link Source} through an
 *         {@link XmlFactories}-hardened reader instead. On Xalan that reader (its deny-all {@link org.xml.sax.EntityResolver} or its own
 *         {@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD}) is what blocks external DTDs and entities.</li>
 * </ul>
