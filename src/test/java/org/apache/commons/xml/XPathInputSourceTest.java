/**
 * Checks that the document parse behind {@code XPath.evaluate(String, InputSource)} (and its compiled {@code XPathExpression} counterpart) cannot pull in an
 * external general entity.
 *
 * <p>The stock JDK and Apache Xalan implement the {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource}-taking {@code evaluate} entry points by provisioning an internal document
 * parser that {@code FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING} on the {@link XPathFactory} does not reach. The {@link HardeningXPathFactory} wrapper parses the input
 * through a hardened {@code DocumentBuilder} instead, so the external reference resolves to empty on the floor (or the parse is rejected outright), while the
 * evaluation itself still works. Tagged {@code xpath}, so it runs under test-stockjdk, test-xalan and test-xalan-xerces; the Saxon engine takes the separate
 * {@code SaxonProvider} path covered by {@code SaxonXPathExternalCallsTest}.</p>
