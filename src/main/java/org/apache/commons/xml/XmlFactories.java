/**
 * Entry point for obtaining hardened JAXP factories.
 *
 * <p>Every method on this class returns a <em>fresh, hardened</em> factory instance. No caching or pooling is performed; callers on a hot path are responsible
 * for their own caching.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Hardening guarantees</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every factory returned by this class makes the same three guarantees, regardless of which JAXP implementation is on the classpath:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>External DTDs are not fetched.</strong></li>
 *   <li><strong>External entities are not resolved.</strong></li>
 *   <li><strong>Internal entity expansion is bounded</strong> by the platform's secure-processing limit, so DoS payloads such as Billion Laughs are rejected
 *       before they exhaust resources.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These guarantees are defined on OpenJDK 8 or later (and JDK distributions built from it). No version of Android supports
 * {@link javax.xml.XMLConstants#FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING}, so on Android (API level 19 or later) the hardening is applied as best-effort without a guarantee,
 * tested as complete starting with API level 33; see the threat model's "Assumptions about the environment".</p>
 *
 * <p>The guarantees hold whether or not the caller opts into DTD validation
 * ({@link javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#setValidating(boolean) setValidating(true)}) or attaches a compiled XSD via
 * {@link javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#setSchema(javax.xml.validation.Schema) setSchema}: every external resource the validation would otherwise
 * fetch (the DTD itself, an {@code xsi:schemaLocation} hint, an external entity referenced from the DTD) remains blocked.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each method on this class adds factory-specific guarantees on top of the three above, documented on the corresponding {@code newXxxFactory()} method.</p>
 *
 * <p>An unresolved external reference resolves to empty content by default, so the parse continues without the resource. To reject it with an exception
 * instead, set the system property {@code org.apache.commons.xml.throwOnUnresolved} to {@code true}; the property is read at resolution time, and references
 * resolved by a caller-supplied resolver are unaffected.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Caller-supplied URIs</h2>
 *
 * <p>A top-level URI passed directly by the caller is fetched as-is: {@code StreamSource(systemId)}, {@code DocumentBuilder.parse(String)}, or a
 * {@code SAXSource} built from a system id all cause the JAXP implementation to open that URI without consulting the hardening layer. Use a
 * {@link javax.xml.transform.URIResolver} or {@link org.xml.sax.EntityResolver} if you need to restrict the top-level fetch.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 *
 * <p>The returned factories inherit the thread-safety properties of the underlying JAXP implementation, which in practice means they are <strong>not
 * guaranteed to be thread-safe</strong>. Create a new factory per thread or synchronize externally.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class itself is thread-safe: all methods are static and stateless.</p>
